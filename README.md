## Basic Concept of Distributed System:  
>A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which then communicate and coordinate  
>their actions by passing messages to one another. Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve   
>computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, 
>which communicate with each other via message passing.

>These machines have a shared state, operate concurrently and can fail independently without affecting the whole system’s uptime.
>A good example to illuminate this concept:

>Let’s compare a traditional database and a distributed database! Traditional databases are stored on the filesystem of one single   
>machine, whenever you want to fetch/insert information in it — you talk to that machine directly.
